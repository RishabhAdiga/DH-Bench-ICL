The stacks are labelled A, B... from left to right. Swap red rectangle from stack C with purple rectangle from stack C. Order the stacks labelled C, B, A from shortest to tallest. Answer in the format A, B, C... where A, B, C... are the labels of the stacks.", "options": ["A, C, B", "B, A, C", "A, B, C", "B, C, A", "C, A, B", "C, B, A"], "img_path": "height_synthetic_2D/images-3-stacks-colored/imgs/img153.jpg", "ground_truth": "B, A, C"}
